    "# Borderlands 2 Weapon Rarity Prediction – First Draft\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For Project 3, I wanted to focus on data from my favorite game of all time, Borderlands 2. The goal is to predict weapon rarity based on various attributes, such as manufacturer, damage type, and required content. Weapon rarity plays a significant role in the game's progression and overall gameplay experience. By predicting rarity based on these attributes, we can provide insights that could assist in understanding weapon distribution and balance. "

    "## What is Regression?\n",
    "Regression is a statistical method used to find relationships between a dependent variable and independent variables. In my project, the dependent variable is weapon rarity, and the independent variables are attributes such as manufacturer, damage type, and required content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression finds the best-fit line that minimizes errors between actual and predicted values. The formula is:\n",
    "Y= β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + ... + βnXn + ϵ\n",
    "\n",
    "For my project, the variables in the equation relate to the following:\n",
    "* Y is the predicted weapon rarity\n",
    "* X1, X2, ... Xn are the independent variables (e.g., manufacturer, damage type, etc.).\n",
    "* B0 is the intercept and Bn are the coefficients\n",
    "* ϵ is the error term"

    "## Experiment 1: Data Understanding\n",
    "The dataset contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Required Content: This one seems pretty relevant for predicting weapon rarity. Some weapons might be tied to specific content packs or downloadable content (DLCs), which could impact their rarity. I plan to keep this feature and see how it influences rarity prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Item Name: Since each item name is unique, it doesn’t really help in predicting weapon rarity. I’ll likely exclude this feature from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Flavor Text Perk: This one is mostly descriptive, but it could be useful for feature engineering later if it turns out to have any patterns connected to weapon rarity. I’ll keep an eye on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Manufacturer: This is a categorical feature (e.g., Hyperion, Jakobs). It could be useful since some manufacturers might have rarer weapons in the game, so it might affect the rarity prediction. I’ll test it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Damage Type: Another categorical feature (e.g., Fire, Corrosive). While it might not directly determine rarity, it could influence it depending on how weapons of different types are distributed in terms of rarity. This is worth exploring.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dropped By: This feature tells us where the weapon drops, but it might not be very useful for predicting rarity. I’ll evaluate it during the analysis phase to see if it’s worth keeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Minimum Task Required: This could provide some valuable insight, especially since higher-difficulty tasks might drop rarer weapons. Depending on how it correlates with rarity, I might include it in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Location: Not sure if this will be a strong predictor for rarity, but it’s still worth checking if certain locations tend to have rarer weapons. I’ll investigate this to see if it’s useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rarity: This is the target variable, the one I’m trying to predict. It includes categories like Common, Rare, and Legendary, which are the different levels of rarity we’ll focus on.\n"
